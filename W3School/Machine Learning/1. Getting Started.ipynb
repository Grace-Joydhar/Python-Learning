Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7dEyAb8gDmei"},"source":["### **Where To Start?**\n","In this tutorial we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how to calculate important numbers based on data sets.\n","\n","We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we need.\n","\n","And we will learn how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome based on what we have learned."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"thFJgWpo2_Si"},"source":["### **Data Set**\n","In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.\n","\n","In Machine Learning it is common to work with very large data sets. In this tutorial we will try to make it as easy as possible to understand the different concepts of machine learning, and we will work with small easy-to-understand data sets."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"prYT42684cGh"},"source":["### **Data Types**\n","To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.\n","\n","We can split the data types into three main categories:\n","1. Numerical\n","2. Categorical\n","3. Ordinal\n","\n","**1. Numerical data** are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:\n","\n","  i) Discrete Data\n","  - numbers that are limited to integers. *Example: The number of cars passing by.*\n","\n","  ii) Continuous Data\n","  - numbers that are of infinite value. *Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item*\n","**2. Categorical data** are values that cannot be measured up against each other. *Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.*\n","\n","**3. Ordinal data** are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. *Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.*"]}]}
