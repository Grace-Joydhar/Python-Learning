It is used for serializing and deserializing an object structure of Python. It serializes the object and Pickles it to save it on a disk. It converts the object like DataFrame, list, dictionary, etc. into a character stream.\n","\n","The best part about Pickle is that it can store various kinds of Python data types.\n","\n","Pickle is widely used for storing trained machine learning algorithm instances. Like JSON, Pickle also has handy functions like pickle.load() for loading a Pickle format file, and pickle.dump() for saving a Pickle or any other format in Pickle format.\n","\n","*Another import advantage of using Pickle is that Saving the dataframe as a Pickle file required less space on the disk and keeps the type of the data intact when reloaded.*\n","\n","- All pandas objects are equipped with to_pickle methods which use python's cPickle module to save data structures to disk using the pickle format."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":205},"id":"WU7ySirdHWk_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1627812257937,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":565,"user":{"displayName":"Grace Joydhar 151-15-5075","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgKKeETNaqJ4iq_FDkzbDh6wV_C8V5QzVIlAuUnLA=s64","userId":"04102875382996925654"}},"outputId":"b8ba6e15-6fb2-43f3-990f-e08d1408c5bd"},"source":["#cryp_fin was created in the html sector\n","import pickle\n","with open('cryp_fin.pickle', 'wb') as sub_data:\n","  pickle.dump(cryp_fin, sub_data, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)\n","cryp_fin = pd.read_pickle('cryp_fin.pickle')\n","cryp_fin.head()"],"execution_count":623,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>Ticker</th>\n","      <th>Last price</th>\n","      <th>%</th>\n","      <th>24 high</th>\n","      <th>24 low</th>\n","      <th>24 volume</th>\n","      <th># Coins</th>\n","      <th>Market cap</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Ethereum</td>\n","      <td>ETH</td>\n","      <td>$ 2,610.27</td>\n","      <td>+2.81%</td>\n","      <td>$ 2,635.56</td>\n","      <td>$ 2,524.38</td>\n","      <td>$ 8.89B</td>\n","      <td>116.92M</td>\n","      <td>$ 305.20B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Bitcoin</td>\n","      <td>BTC</td>\n","      <td>$ 41,913</td>\n","      <td>+0.82%</td>\n","      <td>$ 42,534</td>\n","      <td>$ 41,322</td>\n","      <td>$ 8.79B</td>\n","      <td>18.77M</td>\n","      <td>$ 786.84B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Ripple</td>\n","      <td>XRP</td>\n","      <td>$ 0.767960</td>\n","      <td>+2.75%</td>\n","      <td>$ 0.775921</td>\n","      <td>$ 0.743083</td>\n","      <td>$ 1.75B</td>\n","      <td>46.31B</td>\n","      <td>$ 35.56B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Polkadot</td>\n","      <td>DOT</td>\n","      <td>$ 18.50</td>\n","      <td>+10.02%</td>\n","      <td>$ 19.27</td>\n","      <td>$ 16.64</td>\n","      <td>$ 1.24B</td>\n","      <td>947.85M</td>\n","      <td>$ 17.53B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Ethereumclassic</td>\n","      <td>ETC</td>\n","      <td>$ 52.93</td>\n","      <td>+3.03%</td>\n","      <td>$ 53.89</td>\n","      <td>$ 50.97</td>\n","      <td>$ 1.12B</td>\n","      <td>127.32M</td>\n","      <td>$ 6.73B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["              Name Ticker  Last price  ... 24 volume  # Coins Market cap\n","0         Ethereum    ETH  $ 2,610.27  ...   $ 8.89B  116.92M  $ 305.20B\n","1          Bitcoin    BTC    $ 41,913  ...   $ 8.79B   18.77M  $ 786.84B\n","2           Ripple    XRP  $ 0.767960  ...   $ 1.75B   46.31B   $ 35.56B\n","3         Polkadot    DOT     $ 18.50  ...   $ 1.24B  947.85M   $ 17.53B\n","4  Ethereumclassic    ETC     $ 52.93  ...   $ 1.12B  127.32M    $ 6.73B\n","\n","[5 rows x 9 columns]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":623}]}]}
